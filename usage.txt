thunderbird [--build=] [--source=] [--strictuuids] [--help]

--build=buildDir

  default: t-build
  buildDir is where the built curriculum.json and compiled assets will go.

--source=sourceDir

  default: content
  sourceDir is where the structure.xml, as well as the curriculum contents,
  like lesson and assignment folders, are stored.

--strictuuids

  default: false
  If the strictuuids flag is used, no UUID's will be written to structure.xml,
  and instead Thunderbird will enforce that all units, lessons, and assignemnts
  already have UUID's generated. --strictuuid's is ON when deploying a
  curriculum to master.

--local

  default: false
  If --local is specified AND no --build dir is specified, the Thunderbird build
  is pushed into /usr/local/tmp/t-build, for local testing
  [Work in Progress]
