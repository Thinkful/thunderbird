#Thunderbird

Converts a curriculum from a `structure.xml` file and a bunch of folders
into a curriculum.json. Adds UUIDs, merges metadata, and creates the
curriculum tree.

#Installation

    npm install -g thunderbird
  
#Usage

    thunderbird --help

In most cases, you just need to run the default `thunderbird` in a curriculum directory.

#Updating

`thunderbird` checks for new versions of itself on `npm` every time it runs.
